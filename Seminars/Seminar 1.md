GAP analysis

Gap analysis is a technique that provides a way for determining how available software services can be traced to new business models that best meet an organization’s goals. Gap analysis provides a way to move from existing applications to SOA environments going beyond basic wrapping options. To achieve this objective it is necessary to start capturing the "existing" software application and compare them with "new" business service functions need to be provided in a SOA environment. This comparison between new business functions (to-be), and current capabilities (as-is) originates the concept of "gap analysis".

Continuous integration

Continuous integration is a set of principles that apply to the daily workflow of development teams. All code must be kept in a repository. Git is a common tool, but there are other tools such as Subversion, Perforce, and Mercurial in active use today. There are still some places where using a code repository and versioning the source code aren’t yet part of common practice. In a continuous integration life cycle, when someone checks his or her revised code into the repository, an automated system picks up the change, checks out the code, and runs a set of commands to verify that the change is good and didn’t break anything. This tool is meant to be the unbiased judge of whether a change works or not, thereby preventing the “it works on my machine” syndrome before the code hits production.
When team members’ makes changes in smaller increments and integrates them into the mainline regularly, the benefits go beyond just the development process. Smaller changes, shipped to production quickly, are a lot easier to debug when something breaks. This is one of the key values of continuous integration, and it’s where the name comes from. Rather than living in branches for long chunks of time, changes are continuously integrated.

Road Mapping:

In road mapping, the relevance of the considerations are identified. The final depiction of selected information on the road mapping is the significant step made from the analysis and review of all factors and considerations. A major benefit of the road mapping is its role as a communication tool, and the need for clarity and ease of communication puts limits on the amount of information that can be included in any particular road mapping. This process of selection, from all the information and options analysis, is the core aspect of road mapping generation. It will result in the key enabling technologies, components and sub-systems being shown on the map, leading to the exploitation of a defined market opportunity.

Technical Product management

Technical product management is described as a complex discipline which includes many activities, such as requirements engineering, release planning, finance. The components of product management and the product manager’s responsibilities vary a lot from one organization to another. Product managers’ main responsibilities included a selection of features or requirements for the next product release. In product management, MDRE requirements are gathered externally from customers, partners and internally from developers, marketing managers, and sales managers.

Article discusses about a method for Early Requirements Triage and Selection (MERTS). The method has two main purposes. First, it acts as a stepwise guide to creating product strategies taking both strategic and technical views into account. Secondly, the strategies resulting from MERTS can be used by managers to perform requirements triage, in essence selecting the “right” requirements for realization. The creation of MERTS was preceded by the study of traditional management literature covering strategy formulation, and complemented with exploratory interviews in industry utilizing two technology driven companies working in a market driven context. 
In the early requirements triage there will be three steps for creating initial product strategy.
Step 1: Specify
To specify the directions of movement for the product deduced from the organization’s mission statement. In this step the finding solutions to the three strategic questions is done. Where we want to go?,(2) How to get there?, (3) What will be done?) for each product.
Step 2: Assign weights
The answers from Step 1 are assigned weights. The answers of each question have a total weight of 100 and the total weight of the three questions is 300. The rule is to assign weights to each of the factors based on their relative importance in a way that total weight remains 100.
Step 3: Compare requirements
The person performing triage (requirements comparison) does not need to worry about relative weights and normalizations. The normalization can be done automatically by the tool used (e.g. an excel sheet) after the points have been assigned against each requirement.
Requirements selection can be done in two steps:
Step 1: Specify product technology roadmap 
Roadmap to get an overview of the relationship between product releases (product evolvement) and successive technology generations. This means specifying what a product tends to achieve along the time axis in term of its evolvement and technology trends. This enables placement of requirements in appropriate intervals planned in a roadmap.
Step 2: Estimate resources
In order to determine the feasibility of the requirements, the organization needs to explicitly state financial and effort allowances against each interval in the roadmap. Several methods can be used to estimate cost, effort and time, e.g. feature points, function points, lines of code, and methods like e.g. COCOMO can be used to support the efforts.
Once the strategic questions have been answered, it is important to document the reasoning behind the decisions. This way if the decisions (and indirectly the answers) result in success (of a product) replication can be achieved, and the organization has good examples to follow for future efforts.
It has to be realized that the use of MERTS requires an investment of time and resources to formalize the strategies and homogenize understanding. Although, the investment is not continuous but mostly initial, and should be alleviated by the improved triage, not to mention the benefit of having goals explicitly shared and understood in the organization.

This paper presents a framework of dependent variables that serves as a full range for requirements engineering quality assessment. In this framework, the quality of the SRS itself is just the first level. Other higher, and more significant levels, include whether the project was successful and whether the resulting product was successful. And still higher levels include whether or not the company was successful and whether there was a positive or negative impact on society as a whole. As requirements processes are changed, we may assess their impact on many dependent variables. These dependent variables reside within at least five distinct levels.
1.	Requirements phase
This level includes dependent variables that relate to requirements cost, time and requirements quality.
2.	Project
This level includes dependent variables that relate to project cost, time, project estimates and degree of requirements change.
3.	Product
Requirements selection and degree of impact are the measures of this level.
4.	Company
Portfolio management, strategic alignment and degree of impact are the measures of this level.
5.	Society
Products always give rise to positive and negative externalities that have to be taken into consideration.

This paper discusses about interview study which was performed to identify specific challenges associated with the selection, tradeoff, and management of Quality Requirements (QR) in industrial practice. Data was collected through semistructured interviews with 11 product managers and 11 project leaders from 11 software companies. The contribution of this study is fourfold. First, it compares how QR are handled in two cases, companies working in business-to business (B2B) markets and companies that are working in business-to-consumer markets. These two are also compared in terms of impact on the handling of QR. Second, it compares the perceptions and priorities of QR by product and project management, respectively. Third, it includes an examination of the interdependencies among quality requirements perceived as most important by the practitioners. Fourth, it characterizes the selection and management of QR in downstream development activities.
23 Important QR are identified based on Lauesen’s comparison of ISO9126 and McCall quality factors. The interviewees were asked to rank the top five most important aspects for their products based on their expertise and their own definition of the quality aspect. The interviewees will have to give five points to the most important, four points to the second most important, and so on. The highest prioritized quality aspects were usability followed by performance requirements (45 points), reliability (32 points), and stability (30 points). Apart from prioritizing performance requirements as the second most important QR, B2B and B2C prioritized different quality aspects. B2B companies ranked safety (25 points), performance (24 points), and reliability (22 points) as the three most important quality aspects, while B2C ranked usability (39 points), performance (21 points), and stability (11 points) as the most important ones.
Interdependencies are identified and results show that B2B viewed REQUIRES (R1 requires R2 to function, but not vice versa) as the most common type, while B2C viewed CVALUE (R1 affects the value of R2 for a customer) as the most common one. Cost estimations are performed for QR. Project managers’ estimates cost are slightly higher than project leaders in the normal case. In worst case, the distances between estimation and exact cost are huge. 1. Poor cost estimations; 2. Lack of resources; 3. QR have lower priority than FR are the main three reasons for dismissal of QR.

This paper discusses about cost-value approach which prioritizes requirements according to their relative value and cost. Based on the information, software managers can make decisions such as which requirements to be excluded from the first release to keep the time-to-market at minimum. There are five steps to prioritizing requirements using the cost–value approach.
1. Requirements engineers carefully review candidate requirements for completeness and to ensure that they are stated in an unambiguous way.
2. Customers and users (or suitable substitutes) apply AHP’s pairwise comparison method to assess the relative value of the candidate requirements.
3. Experienced software engineers use AHP’s pairwise comparison to estimate the relative cost of implementing each candidate requirement.
4. A software engineer uses AHP to calculate each candidate requirement’s relative value and implementation cost, and plots these on a cost–value diagram.
5. The stakeholders use the cost– value diagram as a conceptual map for analyzing and discussing the candidate.
